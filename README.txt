This repository is broken into directories containing jupyter notebooks where we completed this project. The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

The EDA directory contains jupyter notebooks where we performed initial EDA before modeling and analysis on our models performance once they were tested.
	lc_initial_eda_alex.ipynb and lc_inital_eda.ipynb is initial eda performed by Alex
	lc_initial_eda_soham.ipynb is initial eda performed by Soham
	model_eda_alex.ipynb is eda on our models' performance by Alex
	pool_EDA_soham.ipynb is eda on our models' performance by Soham
The input csv for the initial eda notebooks is from the provided link ('accepted_2007_to_2016_Q4.csv') and is the data we initially downloaded for this project. It is from LendingClub, downloaded from Kaggle. The input data for the pool_eda notebooks are in this directory.

The model_df_creation directory contains the jupyter notebook we made to create the data frames that would be used to fit and test our models. The input data is 'accepted_2007_to_2016_Q4.csv' from the provided link.

The modeling directory contains the jupyter notebooks we created to train and test our models. The inout csvs are in that directory.

The portfolio_simulations directory contains the jupyter notebook we created to simulate portfolios based on our models' outputs. The input CSVs are in that directory.
